Some single sign on open source software I looked at was Sails, Keycloak, and Gluu. I chose Sails because it was pretty self explanatory and it's the software Goggins used when I went to his office hours. I was able to get Sails fully running on my computer. At first I was overthinking the project and thought he wanted us to make a whole website and login page so I went to office hours and Goggins showed what he wanted exactly and it was much simpler than I initially thought.
