The assignment was fairly straight forward and I did not have many problems with it. One problem I did face though was that some of the commands given were not the correct commands for windows and I had to look up the correct commands. Another problem I had was setting the global variables so again I had to google what the correct commands were to set the variables. By the end I would like for the user to be able to easily change their recipes by implementing buttons that would make it simple and easy to understand for the user.
