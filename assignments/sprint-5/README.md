I used the SSO Goggins showed for the assignment and when you login to your Google account it should list out recipes and there are buttons to create a new recipe, edit a recipe, or delete a recipe. I could not get the buttons to work how I wanted them to and I could not get the website to update the information when using the buttons. Here is some websites that I used.
